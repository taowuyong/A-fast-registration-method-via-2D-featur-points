In this project, we provide the Matlab code of a registration method via 2D feature points. The method first projects the point clouds onto the horizontal plane. Then, the 2D lines are extracted. The intersection points of the 2D lines are treated as the 2D feature points, based on which the point cloud registration is performed. 
Everyone is welcome to use the code for research work, but not for commerce. If you use the code, please cite my paper (Wuyong Tao, Yansheng Xiao, Ruisheng Wang, Tieding Lu, Shaoping Xu. A fast registration method for building point clouds obtained by terrestrial laser scanner via 2D feature points. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing)
In this project, two files are provided. The “line2D” file is used to extracted the 2D lines. The “A fast registration method via 2D feature points” file is used to perform the point cloud registration. 
Before you carry out our algorithm, you need to calculate the point cloud resolution (pr).
